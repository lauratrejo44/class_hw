    "    1.takes a file name as argument\n",
    "    2.opens the file that is formatted like the cleaned version of the canid file we made from the shell \n",

    "    6.returns this dictionary\n",

    "\n",
    "    1.takes a dictionary and output file name as arguments\n",
    "    2.opens a file for writing given the file name in the argument.\n",

    "Repeat parts 1a and 1b with a new family or order from the PBDB. You may use the taxonomic group you have chosen for your final project or another group. Make sure that whatever group you decide to use has at least 100 unique species. Note that you will need to check the Show accepted names only box next to Select by taxonomy to ensure that the field order is the same as in the example file.\n",

    "(Extra Credit) Write a set of python functions that will take species level fossil occurrence data such as that used in parts 1 and 2 and produce the minimum and maximum age of each genus represented in the file. Then use R to plot the stratigraphic ranges of each genus. "
